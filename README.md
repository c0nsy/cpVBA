# cpVBA
VBA work I have done through school

This particular code creates a new sheet for each category (no duplicates)
Then on cells A3 and B3 for each sheet, a formatted header is created
Headings are Products in (whatever category) and Prices in (whatever category)
Then under each product column, only products that match the category in question are added. Including price in the price column
